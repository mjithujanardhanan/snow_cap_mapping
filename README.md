# snow_cap_mapping
this project is aimed at developing a model which can map the snowcap from satellite images

# Introduction

The Indian Himalayas, characterized by their rugged terrain and extreme climatic
conditions, are home to vast expanses of snow-covered landscapes, playing
a critical role in regional hydrology, ecology, and livelihoods. Accurate
monitoring and mapping of snow cover in this region are essential for various
applications, including water resource management, climate change studies,
and hazard mitigation. Satellite remote sensing offers a powerful tool
for observing snow cover dynamics over large spatial extents; however, traditional
methods for snow cover mapping often encounter challenges in complex
mountainous terrains.
In recent years, the advent of machine learning (ML) techniques has provided
new avenues for improving the accuracy and efficiency of snow cover mapping
from satellite imagery. ML algorithms have demonstrated remarkable capabilities
in image classification tasks, leveraging complex patterns and spectral
information to accurately delineate snow-covered areas.
Here we are trying to use ML techniques to identify the pixels which contains
snow. We make use of landsat 8 data which is freely available on internet.
